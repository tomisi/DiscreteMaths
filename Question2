# Question 2:Write a programme that takes as input 2 finite SETS of any size, A;B, and outputs the following:
# a) the truth value of B "is a subset" A
# b) the set A - B
# c) the set A x B.

# we will start by creating 2 variables to store set A and Set B
A = set()
B = set()

# then we will ask the user to enter the number of element they want for the first set
# followed by it's respective elements
n1 = int(input("\n enter the number of elements you want for set A: "))
print("\n Please enter your elements for set A")

for i in range(0, n1):
#this variable will store the the element the user will input
    elements_list1 = input()

#this will allow the addition of elements of the for loop through each iteration that will take place
    A.add(elements_list1)

#this will allow the user to view the elements in set A
print("this is set A : ", A)

# then we will ask the user to enter the number of element they want for the second set
# followed by it's respective elements
n2 = int(input("\n enter the number of elements you want for set B: "))
print("\n Please enter your elements for set B")

for i in range(0, n2):
    # this variable will store the the element the user will input
    elements_list2 = input()

    # this will allow the addition of elements of the for loop through each iteration that will take place
    B.add(elements_list2)  # Adding the element through each iteration of the for loop

#this will allow the user to view the elements in set A
print("this is set B: ", B)

# using the builtin function issubset(), the user will know whether B is a subset of A
print("\n A. The truth value of B 'is a subset of' A is " + str(B.issubset(A)))

#the the user will see the result of  A - B
print("\n B. The set for A - B: ")
print(A - B)

#the the user will see the result cartesian product A x B
print("\n c. The set A x B:")
print(sorted((i, j) for i in A for j in B))
