# Question 1:  Write a python programme to test if a given list of elements constitutes a set. It should take as its input a
# list of elements and should output a True or False value. If the truth value is False then
#it must also output the list converted to a set or to a list which represents the set.

# the first thing that needs to be done is to create an empty list
my_list = []

# Asking number of elements as input
n = int(input("\n how many numbers do you want your list to have?: "))
print("enter the numbers you want:")

# to iterate, we're gonna use the for loop
for i in range(0, n):

    # this variable will store the element input by the user
    elements_list = input()

    # this will add the element through each iteration of the for loop
    my_list.append(elements_list)

# Using the set() python function to convert from the list datatype to the set datatype.
# this variable will convert the list to a set
my_list_set = set(my_list)

# this variable will compare the lengths of the list and the set created from the list
truth_value = (len(my_list) == len(my_list_set)) #this will let the user know if the list is a set

#now we're gonna print the list of numbers input by the user
print("\n The list is: " + str(my_list))

# conditional if-else statement to print the truth value of the comparison of lengths
if truth_value:
    # if the variable 'truth_value' is True, print statement to be executed
    print("\n" + str(truth_value) + ", this list " + str(my_list) + " is a set")

else:
    # if the variable truth_value is False, print statement to be executed
    print("\n" + str(truth_value) + ", the set should be: " + str(sorted(list(my_list_set))))
